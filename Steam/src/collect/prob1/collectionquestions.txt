Questions

1) The core collection interfaces are organized into two distinct inheritance trees. One interface in particular is not considered to be a true Collection, and therefore sits at the top of its own tree. What is the name of this interface? 
Answer: Map.

2) Each interface in the collections framework is declared with the <E> syntax, which tells you that it is generic. When you declare a Collection instance, what is the advantage of specifying the type of objects that it will contain? 
Answer: Specifying the type of objects makes the application type-safe as all type related issues can be detected at compile time.

3) What interface represents a collection that does not allow duplicate elements? 
Answer: Set.

4) What interface forms the root of the collections hierarchy? 
Answer: Collection.

5) What interface represents an ordered collection that may contain duplicate elements? 
Answer: List.

6) What interface represents a collection that holds elements prior to processing? 
Answer: Queue.

7) What interface repesents a type that maps keys to values? 
Answer: Map.

8) What interface represents a double-ended queue? 
Answer: Deque.

9) Name three different ways to iterate over the elements of a List. 
Answer: iterator, listIterator, for each loop, for loop using get(index) and size() methods.

10) True or False: Aggregate operations are mutative operations that modify the underlying collection.
Answer: False, they don't modify the underlying collection.

11)Consider the four core interfaces, Set, List, Queue, and Map. For each of the following four assignments, specify which of the four core interfaces is best-suited, and explain how to use it to implement the assignment.
